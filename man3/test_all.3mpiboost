boost::mpi::test_all \- Tests whether all non\-blocking requests have completed\&.

// In header: <boost/mpi/nonblocking\&.hpp>


template<typename ForwardIterator, typename OutputIterator>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine takes in a set of requests stored in the iterator range
[first,last) and determines whether all of these requests have been completed\&. However, due to limitations of the underlying MPI implementation, if any of the requests refers to a non\-blocking send or receive of a serialized data type,
test_all
will always return the equivalent of
false
(i\&.e\&., the requests cannot all be finished at this time)\&. This routine performs the same functionality as
wait_all, except that this routine will not block\&. This routine provides functionality equivalent to
MPI_Testall\&.

Parameters:
.RS 4
.PP
first
.RS 4
The iterator that denotes the beginning of the sequence of request objects\&.
.RE
.PP
last
.RS 4
The iterator that denotes the end of the sequence of request objects\&.
.RE
.PP
out
.RS 4
If provided and all requests hav been completed, an output iterator through which the status of each request will be emitted\&. The
status
objects are emitted in the same order as the requests are retrieved from
[first,last)\&.
.RE

.PP
Returns:
.RS 4
If an
out
parameter was provided, the value
out
after all of the
status
objects have been emitted (if all requests were completed) or an empty
optional<>\&. If no
out
parameter was provided, returns
true
if all requests have completed or
false
otherwise\&.
