.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Flags used to customize the behavior of the regex algorithms
.PP
match_default
.RS 4
Specifies that matching of regular expressions proceeds without any modification of the normal rules used in ECMA\-262, ECMAScript Language Specification, Chapter 15 part 10, RegExp (Regular Expression) Objects (FWD\&.1)
.RE
.PP
match_not_bol
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression "^" should not be matched against the sub\-sequence [first,first)\&.
.RE
.PP
match_not_eol
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression "\e$" should not be matched against the sub\-sequence [last,last)\&.
.RE
.PP
match_not_bow
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression "\e\eb" should not be matched against the sub\-sequence [first,first)\&.
.RE
.PP
match_not_eow
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression "\e\eb" should not be matched against the sub\-sequence [last,last)\&.
.RE
.PP
match_any
.RS 4
Specifies that if more than one match is possible then any match is an acceptable result\&.
.RE
.PP
match_not_null
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression can not be matched against an empty sequence\&.
.RE
.PP
match_continuous
.RS 4
Specifies that the expression must match a sub\-sequence that begins at first\&.
.RE
.PP
match_partial
.RS 4
Specifies that if no match can be found, then it is acceptable to return a match [from, last) where from != last, if there exists some sequence of characters [from,to) of which [from,last) is a prefix, and which would result in a full match\&.
.RE
.PP
match_prev_avail
.RS 4
Specifies that
<ndash></ndash>first is a valid iterator position, when this flag is set then the flags match_not_bol and match_not_bow are ignored by the regular expression algorithms (RE\&.7) and iterators (RE\&.8)\&.
.RE
.PP
format_default
.RS 4
Specifies that when a regular expression match is to be replaced by a new string, that the new string is constructed using the rules used by the ECMAScript replace function in ECMA\-262, ECMAScript Language Specification, Chapter 15 part 5\&.4\&.11 String\&.prototype\&.replace\&. (FWD\&.1)\&. In addition during search and replace operations then all non\-overlapping occurrences of the regular expression are located and replaced, and sections of the input that did not match the expression, are copied unchanged to the output string\&.
.RE
.PP
format_sed
.RS 4
Specifies that when a regular expression match is to be replaced by a new string, that the new string is constructed using the rules used by the Unix sed utility in IEEE Std 1003\&.1\-2001, Portable Operating SystemInterface (POSIX), Shells and Utilities\&.
.RE
.PP
format_perl
.RS 4
Specifies that when a regular expression match is to be replaced by a new string, that the new string is constructed using an implementation defined superset of the rules used by the ECMAScript replace function in ECMA\-262, ECMAScript Language Specification, Chapter 15 part 5\&.4\&.11 String\&.prototype\&.replace (FWD\&.1)\&.
.RE
.PP
format_no_copy
.RS 4
When specified during a search and replace operation, then sections of the character container sequence being searched that do match the regular expression, are not copied to the output string\&.
.RE
.PP
format_first_only
.RS 4
When specified during a search and replace operation, then only the first occurrence of the regular expression is replaced\&.
.RE
.PP
format_literal
.RS 4
Treat the format string as a literal\&.
.RE
.PP
format_all
.RS 4
Specifies that all syntax extensions are enabled, including conditional (?ddexpression1:expression2) replacements\&.
.RE
