.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a Windows\-specific macro, which will be used internally to state the calling convention of any function that is to be used as a callback from MPI\&. For example, the internally\-defined functions that are used in a call to
MPI_Op_create\&. This macro is likely only to be useful to users that wish to bypass Boost\&.MPI, registering their own callbacks in certain cases, e\&.g\&., through
MPI_Op_create\&.
