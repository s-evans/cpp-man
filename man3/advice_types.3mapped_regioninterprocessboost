.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This enum specifies region usage behaviors that an application can specify to the mapped region implementation\&.
.PP
advice_normal
.RS 4
Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its behavior with respect to the region\&. It is the default characteristic if no advice is given for a range of memory\&.
.RE
.PP
advice_sequential
.RS 4
Specifies that the application expects to access the region sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses\&. The implementation can lower the priority of preceding pages within the region once a page have been accessed\&.
.RE
.PP
advice_random
.RS 4
Specifies that the application expects to access the region in a random order, and prefetching is likely not advantageous\&.
.RE
.PP
advice_willneed
.RS 4
Specifies that the application expects to access the region in the near future\&. The implementation can prefetch pages of the region\&.
.RE
.PP
advice_dontneed
.RS 4
Specifies that the application expects that it will not access the region in the near future\&. The implementation can unload pages within the range to save system resources\&.
