.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The kurtosis of a sample distribution is defined as the ratio of the 4th central moment and the square of the 2nd central moment (the variance) of the samples, minus 3\&. The term
\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2 [$ -3 $]
is added in order to ensure that the normal distribution has zero kurtosis\&. The kurtosis can also be expressed by the simple moments:

where
\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2 [$ \widehat{m}_n^{(i)} $]
are the
\&\s-2\u[7]\d\s+2[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[8]\d\s+2 [$ i $]\-th moment and
\&\s-2\u[9]\d\s+2[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2 [$ \hat{\mu}_n $]
the mean (first moment) of the
\&\s-2\u[11]\d\s+2[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[12]\d\s+2 [$ n $]
samples\&.
.PP
The kurtosis estimator for weighted samples is formally identical to the estimator for unweighted samples, except that the weighted counterparts of all measures it depends on are to be taken\&.
