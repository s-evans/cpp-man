Manpages for C++.

Created using the libstdc++ man pages and by generating the boost man pages.
Note that not all boost libraries are set up to generate documentation, so not
all are represented.

Generating boost manpages is accomplished by: 
* downloading boost source
* compiling the b2 utility that comes with boost
* navigating to the libs/<boost_lib>/doc folder
* invoking b2 to build the man page target (ie. 'b2 man')

libstdc++ man pages are available on most linux distros by installing the
libstdc++-<version>-doc package.

Included is a python script that translates the filenames of the manpages into
something easier to search though. This way, a user can invoke something easier
like 'man unique_ptr' instead of 'man std::unique_ptr'. This also makes it
easier to integrate with help systems built into editors like vim.

Users can install these man pages by setting the man path to include this
directory in their bashrc file. (ie. export MANPATH=`manpath`:`pwd`)

In order to disambiguate manpages that might conflict (ie. vector) there are a
few options. Using the '-a' option shows all results of a manpage search in
succession. Using the '-e' option enables users to specify an extension
substring. (ie. 'man -e boost vector' or 'man -e std vector')
